- A classify client should be added to the project
- The frontend should have minimal changes that load all of the 4 schemas rather than just one schema
- The item details page should select the schema based on the classification
- There are no lint ignore errors
- There are no getattr/setattr/hasattr calls in the code
- There should be a new step dedicated to classify
- The generated schema is appropriate given the use case of "financial analysis & investment research"
